\section{Introduction}
This paper reviews results about a modular operator \cite{Longo_1978} and a Holevo's commutation operator \cite{Holevo_1977} in the simplest case.
We mainly deal with the von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak{N}=M_n(\mathbb{C})$, 
which is the ensemble of bounded linear operators on 
the Hilbert space $\mathfrak{H}=\mathbb{C}^n$ with the inner product $(x,y)=\bar{x}^Ty$. 

Let $\rho$ be a non-degenerated density operator and 
$\omega$ be the corresponding normal state given by $\omega(A)=\mbox{Tr}\rho A$.
Considering an inner product on $\mathfrak{N}$

\begin{equation}
\label{innerP}
\langle A, B \rangle =\frac{1}{2}\omega(BA^{\ast}+A^{\ast}B),
\end{equation}
and a bilinear form on $\mathfrak{N}$
\begin{equation}
[A,B]=i\omega(A^{\ast}B-BA^{\ast}),
\end{equation}
we introduce an operator $\mathfrak{D}$ by 
\begin{equation}
[A,X]=\langle A, \mathfrak{D}X\rangle.
\end{equation}
The operator $\mathfrak{D}$, called a commutation operator, plays an important role in the quantum estimation theory.

We consider $\mathfrak{N}$ as a Hilbert-Schmidt space with the inner product
$$
\langle A, B \rangle_2 =\mbox{Tr}(A^{\ast}B),
$$
and denote it by $\mathfrak{H}_2$.
Then we get a $\ast$-representation 
$$
\ell :\mathfrak{N}\to \mathfrak{B}(\mathfrak{H}_2),
$$
where $\mathfrak{B}(\mathfrak{H}_2)$ is the ensemble of bounded operators on $\mathfrak{H}_2$
and $\ell(A)B=AB$.
The state $\omega$ can be written by the inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot\rangle_2$ as 
$$
\omega(A)=\mbox{Tr}(\rho^{1/2}A\rho^{1/2})=\langle \rho^{1/2},\ell(A)\rho^{1/2}\rangle_2 .
$$
Now we can define the modular operator $\Delta$ for the von Neumann algebra $\mathfrak{M}=\ell(\mathfrak{N})$ and its cyclic separating vector $\rho^{1/2}$. 
Our purpose is to see such derived modular operator is related to the commutation operator
as
$$
    \Delta=\left(1+\frac{i}{2}\mathfrak{D}\right)\left(1-\frac{i}{2}\mathfrak{D}\right)^{-1}.
$$
