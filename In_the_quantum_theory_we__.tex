In the quantum theory we consider additional bilinear form on $\mathfrak{H}$ 
\begin{equation}\label{Bform}
[A,B]=i\omega(A^{\ast}B-BA^{\ast}).
\end{equation}
and  obtain fundamental inequalities 
$$
\langle X, X\rangle \geq \pm \frac{i}{2}[X,X],
$$
which yield  the uncertainty relation of the most general form \cite{Holevo_1977}.
We define a commutation operator $\mathfrak{D}$ so that it satisfies 
\begin{equation}\label{Copr}
[A,X]=\langle A, \mathfrak{D}X\rangle.
\end{equation}
The operator $\mathfrak{D}$, firstly introduced by Holevo \cite{Holevo_1977}, plays an important role in the non-commutative statistical theory. From Eq. (\ref{Bform}) it holds that 
\begin{equation}
1\pm \frac{i}{2}\mathfrak{D}\geq 0.
\end{equation}
